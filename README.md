Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are:

1. Rock: A fist.
2. Paper: Open hand, with fingers extended.
3. Scissors: Fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.

The rules of the game dictate the outcomes based on the shapes formed:

- Rock beats Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors.
- Scissors beats Paper: Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper beats Rock: Paper covers Rock.

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a draw and is often played again.

Here's a summary of the outcomes:

- Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins.
- Scissors vs. Paper: Scissors wins.
- Paper vs. Rock: Paper wins.
- Rock vs. Rock: Draw.
- Scissors vs. Scissors: Draw.
- Paper vs. Paper: Draw.

The goal of the game is to choose a shape that will beat your opponent's shape. It's a simple and fun game that's often used as a decision-making tool or as a quick way to resolve disputes.
